                <p>Canada’s chattering classes are apparently confused by findings in recent polls that while Canadians say they care about fighting human-induced climate change, they’re also unwilling to part with a lot of money to do it.</p>
                <p>They shouldn’t be.</p>    
                <p>I’ve been reading polls on this issue for well over a decade and the basic rule of thumb is that while two-thirds of the public say they want action to address climate change, two-thirds become far less enthusiastic when the costs are explained to them.</p>    
                <p>Recent polls by Public Square Research and Maru/Blue for the CBC, and by Nanos Research for secondstreet.org came to similar findings.</p>        
                <p>The CBC’s report on the poll said that while 4,500 Canadians surveyed from May 31 to June 10 collectively identified climate change as their second greatest worry, 32% were unwilling to pay anything to address it.</p>
