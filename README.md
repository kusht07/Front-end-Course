### Node.js - Server Side

*   [Node.jsÂ®](https://nodejs.org/) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
    
*   It was created by [Ryan Dahl](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) in 2009
    
*   We'll use Node.js from now on to learn the language and run our JavaScript exercises
    
*   Once we know the language core concepts we'll learn about the Browsers API's
    
*   [Download & install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    
*   [Install Node.js & npm Windows](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows)
    
*   After installing Node.js open a terminal window and run the following command:
    

node --version
v8.11.11

*   Also check that you have npm installed too:

*   Now that we know that we have installed Node.js & npm we can use it
